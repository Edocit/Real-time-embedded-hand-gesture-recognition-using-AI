We used an ad-hoc modified version of the HaGRID dataset. It includes 552.992 FullHD (1920Ã—1080) RGB images divided into 18 classes of gestures, reported in the figure above, for a total size of 716 GB. The data is split into a training set and a test set, with 509.323 images for training (92%) and 43.669 images for testing (8%). On these images we applied data augmentation strategies to improve the number and the quality of the images
